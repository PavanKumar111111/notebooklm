## How to Run Locally

### Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd notebooklm-clone-deploy/backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd notebooklm-clone-deploy/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended)

**Backend (Render):**
1. Create account at render.com
2. New Web Service → Upload backend folder
3. Build: `npm install`, Start: `npm start`
4. Copy deployment URL

**Frontend (Netlify):**
1. Create account at netlify.com
2. Build locally: `cd frontend && npm run build`
3. Deploy dist folder
4. Add env var: `VITE_BACKEND_URL=<your-render-url>`
5. Redeploy

### Option 2: Git-Based Deployment

See DEPLOYMENT.md for complete Git-based deployment instructions.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18.2
- Vite 5.0
- Modern CSS

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express
- Multer (file uploads)
- pdf-parse (text extraction)
- Simple keyword-based search

## Assignment Requirements Met

|------------|--------|----------------|
| PDF Upload | ✅ | Multer + pdf-parse |
| PDF Viewing | ✅ | Built-in viewer component |
| Chat Interface | ✅ | React-based chat UI |
| Citations | ✅ | Clickable page buttons |
| Page Navigation | ✅ | Ref-based scrolling |
| Token Optimization | ✅ | Keyword-based retrieval |
| Deployment Ready | ✅ | Netlify + Render configs |
| Documentation | ✅ | 5 comprehensive docs |
| Clean UI | ✅ | Responsive design |

## Features Implemented

### Core Features
- Drag-and-drop PDF upload
- Server-side PDF text extraction
- Page-by-page text parsing
- Real-time chat interface
- Citation generation with page references
- Click-to-navigate citations
- Error handling and validation

### Code Quality
- Component-based architecture
- Environment variable support
- CORS configuration
- Modular backend utilities
- Clean separation of concerns
- Deployment configurations included

## Testing the Application

1. **Upload Test**: Upload a PDF (try the included example_assignment_spec.pdf)
2. **Chat Test**: Ask "What is the main objective?"
3. **Citation Test**: Click a citation button to navigate to the page
4. **Error Test**: Try uploading without a file selected

## Deployment URLs

After deployment, update this section:
```
Backend:  https://_________.onrender.com
Frontend: https://_________.netlify.app
```

## Production Enhancements (Optional)

The current implementation uses:
- Simple keyword matching (works great for demos)
- Mock LLM responses (shows the flow)
- In-memory storage (resets on restart)

For production, consider:
- Real OpenAI/Gemini API integration
- Vector database (Pinecone/Supabase)
- User authentication
- Persistent storage
- Rate limiting

Instructions for these enhancements are in SETUP.md.

## File Manifest

Essential files included:
- ✅ All source code (frontend + backend)
- ✅ package.json with dependencies
- ✅ Configuration files (vite, netlify, render)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ .gitignore for clean repo
- ✅ Environment variable templates

NOT included (as per best practices):
- ❌ node_modules (install with npm)
- ❌ dist/build folders (generate with npm build)
- ❌ .env files with secrets
- ❌ uploads folder

## Support

All questions answered in the documentation:
- Getting started → QUICK_START.md
- Full documentation → README.md  
- Deployment help → DEPLOYMENT.md
- Technical details → SETUP.md
